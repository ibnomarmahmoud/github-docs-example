# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.


- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with qoutation (')

```
# Define a Person class
class Person
  # Constructor
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name    # Instance variable for the person's name
    @age = age      # Instance variable for the person's age
  end

  # Instance method to return a greeting
  def greeting
    "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks

```ruby
# Define a Person class
class Person
  # Constructor
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name    # Instance variable for the person's name
    @age = age      # Instance variable for the person's age
  end

  # Instance method to return a greeting
  def greeting
    "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end
```

- Make note of where the backtick button is located.
-It should appear above the tab key, 
- but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console.



```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
        2: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        1: from (irb):1
RuntimeError: This is a custom error message
```

> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavoured Markdown Task Lists

Github extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |

# Step 5 - how to create a table


You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#external-references)
